# Letâ€™s practice using Puppet to make

# Just as in the previous configuration
# file task, weâ€™d like you to set up your
# client SSH configuration file so that you
# can connect to a server without typing a password.
#
#   Your SSH client configuration must be
# configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
#   Your SSH client configuration must be
# configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
